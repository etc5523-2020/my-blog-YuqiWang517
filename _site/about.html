<h1>Data sources and description</h1>
<p>The dataset in this Blog we used from the Republic of Ireland (Department of Health) <span class="citation">(Ireland, n.d.)</span> and WHO.</p>
<p>From the 31 December 2019 to the 21 March 2020, WHO <span class="citation">(WHO, n.d.)</span> collected the numbers of confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths through official communications under the International Health Regulationsrecords and recorded the counts of new cases and deaths in 216 countries around the world starting from 2020/03/01.</p>
<p>The new case and death counts are calculated by subtracting the previous cumulative total from the current count. All data represent the date of the report, not the date of the onset of symptoms. This Blog focuses on observing Irish data.</p>

<p>From this table and pie chart, The biggest confirmed group(23.2%) is upper than 65 years old. Then, age25-34, age35-44 and age45-54 are approximately same as 17%.<br />
From the data, it can be seen that the elder people over the age of 65 have the highest risk of getting the disease. The Irish Ministry of Health also stated that more than 90% of the deceased are over the age of 65, and most of them suffer from basic diseases or live in nursing homes <span class="citation">(Cullen 2020)</span>. Furthermore, a number of former Irish football players <span class="citation">(“COVID-19 Pandemic in the Republic of Ireland” 2020)</span> (Tom Scully(1930) – former football manager, Danny Delaney(before the 1950s) – Former footballer, Tom Mulholland(1936) – Former footballer, Dave Bacuzzi(1940)–Former association football player and manager) all over 65 years old passed away in this infectious disease.</p>
